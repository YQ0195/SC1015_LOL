SC1015 mini project
# About 
This is a mini project for SC1015 and we decided to work with a [dataset of statistics from "League of Legends" game](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bobbyscience/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min?select=high_diamond_ranked_10min.csv)
# Problem definition
Our group decided to find out the factors that contribute to a Victory in a League Of Lengends ranked game.
We want to find out the importance of getting leads early on in the game.

Using Logistic regression and Decision Tree models to find a relationship between the chosen factors and victory.

Comparing both models to find out which model best predicts it.
# Conclusion
Due to the high number of false negative rates, there is still a very good chance of winning despite being behind at the 10th minute mark, and that games are winnable if you play them out.
# What did we learn from this project
We learned about fitting the Logistic regression model and what it tells us, as well as the possibility of stopping snowball leads in "League of Legends".
